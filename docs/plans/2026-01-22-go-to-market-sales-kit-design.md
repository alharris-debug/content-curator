## Part 1: Sales Assets

### Ideal Client Profiles (ICP)

#### Segment A: Small Business Owners

**Who they are:**
- Solo or micro-business owners (1-5 employees)
- Local service businesses: realtors, dentists, chiropractors, salons, contractors, fitness studios, restaurants
- Revenue: $50K-$500K/year
- Doing their own marketing or have a part-time VA helping

**Where to find them:**
- Facebook Groups: local business networks, industry-specific groups ("Realtors of [City]", "Small Business Owners")
- Reddit: r/smallbusiness, r/entrepreneur, r/sweatystartup
- LinkedIn: Job title searches for "Owner" + industry keywords
- Instagram: Local business hashtags, location tags

**Signals they're a fit:**
- Posting inconsistently (gaps of weeks between posts)
- Low-quality or generic content
- Asking for social media help in groups
- Complaining about time or "wearing too many hats"

#### Segment B: Freelance Social Media Managers

**Who they are:**
- Solo freelancers managing 3-15 clients
- Often former marketing employees who went independent
- Revenue: $30K-$100K/year
- Juggling content creation, scheduling, reporting, and client communication

**Where to find them:**
- LinkedIn: "Freelance Social Media Manager," "Social Media Consultant"
- Facebook Groups: freelancer communities, VA networks
- Reddit: r/socialmedia, r/freelance
- Twitter/X: #FreelanceSMM, #SocialMediaManager

**Signals they're a fit:**
- Posting about being overwhelmed or burned out
- Asking about tools to streamline workflows
- Celebrating new client wins (scaling pain incoming)

#### Cross-Segment Signal: "ChatGPT Strugglers"

**Who they are:**
- Already using ChatGPT (or Claude, Gemini, etc.) for social content
- But doing it the hard way: re-explaining their business every session, no saved context, manually reformatting for each platform, juggling multiple browser tabs for multiple clients

**Why they're prime prospects:**
- Zero education needed on "AI can write posts" - they already believe
- They've felt the pain of the workaround and know something better should exist
- Switching cost is low (they're not paying for anything, just wasting time)

**Where to find them:**
- Reddit: r/ChatGPT, r/ArtificialIntelligence - search "social media," "content," "prompts"
- Facebook/LinkedIn: Posts asking "what's your ChatGPT prompt for [platform]?"
- YouTube comments: Under "ChatGPT for social media" tutorials
- Twitter/X: People sharing screenshots of ChatGPT writing their posts

**Signals they're a fit:**
- Sharing "prompt templates" they've built (shows they're trying to systematize)
- Complaining about ChatGPT "forgetting" their brand voice
- Asking how to use ChatGPT for multiple clients/businesses

---

### Value Propositions

#### For Small Business Owners

**Primary hook:**
> "Stop spending your evenings writing social media posts. Generate a week's worth of content in 10 minutes."

**Supporting points:**
- Your brand voice, saved once, used forever - no re-explaining to AI every time
- Posts tailored for Google Business, Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn in one click
- Built for business owners, not marketers - no learning curve

**Cost comparison angle:**
> "A social media agency costs $500-2,000/month. Content Curator is $15-29/month and you stay in control."

#### For Freelance Social Media Managers

**Primary hook:**
> "Manage all your clients' content from one dashboard. Stop juggling tabs, docs, and ChatGPT windows."

**Supporting points:**
- Each client's brand voice, industry, and audience saved in their profile
- Generate platform-specific posts without copy-pasting or reformatting
- Scale from 5 clients to 15 without hiring help

**Efficiency angle:**
> "Cut content creation time by 80%. Spend that time landing new clients instead."

#### For ChatGPT Strugglers (both segments)

**Primary hook:**
> "You already use AI for content. This is AI that actually remembers your business."

**Supporting points:**
- No more "act as a social media manager for a [business type]" every session
- No more reformatting the same post for four different platforms
- No more losing that perfect prompt you wrote last month

**Upgrade angle:**
> "ChatGPT is a blank canvas. Content Curator is a content machine built for social media."

### Cold DM Scripts

#### For Small Business Owners (Facebook groups, LinkedIn)

```
Hey [Name] - saw your post about [specific thing they mentioned: time, social media struggle, etc.].

Quick question: how are you currently handling your social media content? Doing it yourself or outsourcing?

I ask because I work with a tool that lets business owners generate a full week of posts in about 10 minutes - for Google, Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn. Runs about $15/month vs $500+ for an agency.

Happy to show you a quick demo if you're curious. No pressure either way.
```

#### For Freelancers (LinkedIn, Twitter, freelancer groups)

```
Hey [Name] - noticed you're managing social media for multiple clients. Quick question: how are you handling content creation across all of them?

I've been working with freelancers who were drowning in ChatGPT tabs and Google Docs - they switched to a tool that keeps each client's brand voice saved and generates platform-ready posts in one click.

Most are saving 5-10 hours a week. Worth a quick look?
```

#### For ChatGPT Strugglers (Reddit, Twitter, YouTube comments)

```
Saw your post about using ChatGPT for social content - I was doing the same thing for a while. Got tired of re-explaining my business every session and reformatting everything manually.

Started using something that keeps my brand voice saved and spits out posts for all 4 platforms at once. Game changer honestly.

Happy to share what it is if you're interested.
```

---

### Objection Handling

#### "I already use ChatGPT for free"

> Totally get it - I did too for a while. The difference is ChatGPT forgets everything between sessions. You're re-explaining your business, your tone, your audience every time. Content Curator saves all that once, so you just hit generate. Plus it formats for each platform automatically - no more copy-pasting and tweaking for Instagram vs LinkedIn.
>
> It's basically ChatGPT with a memory and a workflow built for social media. Worth trying the difference.

#### "I don't have the budget right now"

> I hear you. Quick math though - if you're spending even 3-4 hours a week on social content, that's 15+ hours a month. At $15/month for Starter, you're paying about $1/hour to get that time back.
>
> Most people use that time to actually run their business or land more clients. Usually pays for itself in the first week.

#### "I tried a tool like this before and it didn't work"

> Fair - a lot of AI tools spit out generic garbage. What makes this different is it learns your specific brand voice, your industry, and your audience. So the posts actually sound like you, not like a robot wrote them.
>
> Might be worth a quick look just to see the difference. If it's not noticeably better, no hard feelings.

#### "I don't have time to learn a new tool"

> That's actually the whole point - there's basically nothing to learn. You fill out your business info once, pick a platform, and hit generate. Takes about 2 minutes to get your first posts.
>
> It's less time than writing one post manually.

#### "I'll think about it" / Going cold

> No worries at all - it's not going anywhere. If you want, I can send you a quick 2-minute video showing how it works. Watch it whenever. And if social media is still eating your time in a few weeks, you know where to find me.

### Demo Video Script (2 minutes)

**[0:00-0:15] Hook**
> "If you're using ChatGPT to write social media posts, you're doing it the hard way. Let me show you something that takes 2 minutes instead of 20."

**[0:15-0:35] The Problem**
> "Here's what most people do: open ChatGPT, explain their business, ask for a post, copy it, tweak it for Instagram, then do it again for Facebook, then LinkedIn. Next week? Start over. ChatGPT forgot everything."

**[0:35-0:55] The Solution - Show the Dashboard**
> "Content Curator remembers your business. I set up my brand voice, my industry, my audience once. Now watch this..."

**[0:55-1:25] The Demo - Generate Posts**
> "I pick a topic, hit generate, and I get posts for Google Business, Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn - all formatted correctly, all in my voice. That's a week of content in about 10 minutes."
>
> *[Show the generation happening, scroll through the outputs]*

**[1:25-1:45] The Extras**
> "Every client I manage has their own profile. I switch between them in one click. All my past posts are saved. No more digging through ChatGPT history."

**[1:45-2:00] CTA**
> "Starts at $15 a month - less than one hour of your time is worth. Link's below if you want to try it."

### Social Post Templates

#### Reddit (r/smallbusiness, r/socialmedia, r/entrepreneur, r/ChatGPT)

**Reply to "How do you handle social media for your business?"**
```
I was spending way too much time on this until I found a system that works. I use a tool that saves my brand voice and generates posts for all 4 platforms at once - Google Business, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn. Takes me about 10 minutes to get a week's worth of content now.

Happy to share what I use if anyone's interested.
```

**Reply to "What's your ChatGPT prompt for social media posts?"**
```
I used to have a whole prompt template saved, but honestly got tired of pasting it every session and reformatting for each platform. Switched to a dedicated tool that keeps my business info saved and outputs platform-ready posts. Way less friction.

Still uses AI under the hood, just built specifically for social content.
```

**Reply to "How do you manage social media for multiple clients?"**
```
This was killing me until I found the right setup. I use Content Curator - each client has their own profile with brand voice, industry, audience saved. I switch between them in one click and generate posts without re-explaining anything. Went from 2 hours per client per week to maybe 20 minutes.
```

#### LinkedIn (personal posts)

**Story-style post:**
```
I used to spend Sunday nights writing social media posts for the week.

Now I spend 10 minutes.

The difference? I stopped using ChatGPT like a blank canvas and started using a tool built specifically for social content.

It remembers my brand voice. It formats for each platform. It keeps everything organized.

If you're still copy-pasting prompts and reformatting posts manually, there's a better way.

DM me if you want to see what I switched to.
```

**Problem-focused post:**
```
Hot take: ChatGPT is a terrible social media tool.

Not because the AI is bad. Because the workflow is bad.

- It forgets your business every session
- You have to reformat every post for every platform
- There's no way to organize multiple clients

I switched to something purpose-built and I'm never going back.

Happy to share what it is - just drop a comment or DM.
```

#### Facebook Groups (business owner groups, freelancer communities)

**Casual share:**
```
Just wanted to share something that's been saving me a ton of time in case it helps anyone else.

I was using ChatGPT to write my social media posts but got tired of explaining my business every time and reformatting everything for different platforms.

Found a tool called Content Curator that saves my brand info and generates posts for Google, Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn all at once. $15/month and I'm getting hours back every week.

Not affiliated, just a fan. Happy to answer questions if anyone's curious.
```

**Responding to "I need help with social media" posts:**
```
I was in the same boat - social media felt like a part-time job on top of running my actual business.

Two things helped: batching (I do all my content in one sitting) and using a tool that generates platform-specific posts from my brand voice automatically.

Takes me about 10 minutes now to get a full week of content. DM me if you want details on the tool I use.
```

### Technical Implementation

#### Option A: Standalone App (Recommended for sales team)

**Stack:**
- React + Vite (same as Content Curator for consistency)
- Tailwind CSS
- Supabase for data persistence (saved searches, custom scripts)
- Claude API for prospect finder AI suggestions

**Hosting:**
- Vercel (separate project or subdomain: sales.contentcurator.com)

**Auth:**
- Simple password protection or Supabase auth
- Only internal team needs access

#### Option B: Section within Content Curator

**Pros:**
- Single codebase
- Shared auth
- Could eventually expose parts to customers (e.g., "share with your team")

**Cons:**
- Clutters the main product
- Different user (sales) than customer

**Recommendation:** Start as standalone app. Can merge later if needed.
